# AlbBoi-Project
This is a project that encompasses PCB design, microcontroller programming in C, Schematic Design, 3D, and CAD modeling. My project is to create a device similar to a Gameboy using the ATSAML21J18B microcontroller. The final product is a PCB with a 3D printed enclosure that will allow users to play games.
